# DocVisualizer

App to visualize documentation for operators on their work stations.


## General Information

Background:
The idea appeared during one of the project lead by me.
Because of lots of products produced on various work stations, there were lots of paper documentation around.
Finding needed documentation costs huge amount of time.

The problem:
That huge amount of paper documentation caused that operators find difficult to find needed information in most cases loosing lots of time to do so.
I noticed that in order to avoid loosing time, during checking documention, workers started to work not according to instructions given in documentation = Quality concerns.

The solution:  
Creation of desktop application for visualization of documentation that are only needed during producing specific product.
No papers will be needed and information given to operator will be focused only for what is needed in present process stage.
Additionaly documents will be presented in two languages, depends what language is needed for operator. 
App is easily installable and configurable on any production computers by leaders of production areas.
